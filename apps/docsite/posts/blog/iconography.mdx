title: Iconography in React
---

Over the last few years we've learned that whenever we start building a component library or a design system,
we shouldn't rush into building components right away.
We should start by defining the foundations for it first,
including all the tokens that become building blocks for our components.
These tokens include all the styling values you would use to build components,
like colors, units, typography and so on.
However, there is another foundational part of any system that's more on the component side of things yet
it is needed for building most of other components.
I'm talking about iconography.

In my experience, there is this moment after you start building your product UI, and you have to add your first
component with icon rendered in it .
That's the moment when you have to stop for a second and zoom out.
You can just drop-in some SVG file imports in your React code.
That's fine at first unless you want your iconography approach to be aligned across the project or
sometimes multiple projects.

Once you start to scale your solution you might stumble upon all sorts of decisions you have to make.
Some of them are pretty straightforward while others are not lying on the surface at all.
Let's highlight the most common ones.

## File format

The first one is picking the file format for the icons.
I find it solved and obvious for the majority of people, but it's great to go over it once again.
After an era of png icons we all got into a world of retina screens and found out it's easier
to use icons when you don't have to provide 2x or 3x assets separately.
Instead, we've started using icon fonts or SVG.

Both of them can be scaled on different screens but with better browser support at that time
font icons gained massive popularity at first.
Couple of years later, there are no browser support issues and SVG is the way to go.
It provides a better control over its rendering, positioning and since SVG icons are a couple lines of code
— you have control over its every tiny detail.
Additionally, it can be easily exported from any design tool we currently have.
So picking SVG should be a no-brainer nowadays.

## Integrating into React app

Now that we're using SVG format, there are 2 approaches for integrating the icons.
Either you go for a Webpack loader that allows importing SVG files as a string,
or you just convert SVG files to React components beforehand.

When I've just started with React 4 years ago — I remember that most people including me were using the loader approach.
You would just import an SVG file and insert it into you html with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property.
That was mostly happening because of incomplete support for SVG elements and that changed with the [React v15](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/04/07/react-v15.html) release.
Time has passed and now you would see majority of icon packs exporting their icons as React components and quite
some tooling that lets you convert SVG files to React components and optimize the output, like SVGR.

This will get SVG code into your React app but then you get to a question about icon styles customization and its consistency.
Surely you can make every icon support style attribute.
That's a quick solution that works well but over time you will have no control over the consistent usage of the icons.
What I recommend instead is creating an Icon utility controlling all aspects of the used SVG assets.

There are a couple of tricks you can use with this utility:

**1.** If you don't know which icons will be used in the product beforehand, and you don't want to include the whole iconset into your bundle —
let developers pass SVG components directly to your utility.

**2.** Use size presets or token names instead of numerical values.
Usually you would need around 5-6 sizes to make the component really flexible.

**3.** Don't ask developers to provide a color for an icon every time it's used in a new context.
Instead, use `currentColor` in css.
That's especially useful when your icons are monochrome.
In that case you can simplify them by using elements like `<path>` and then use `fill: currentColor` in the utility itself to color them all.

```tsx
import { Icon } from "@uicapsule/components";
import IconZap from "icons/Zap";

const Component = () => <Icon svg={IconZap} size={8} />;
```

## Bounding boxes

Let's say we have a lightning icon and a chevron icon.
When used together we want chevron to have less visual weight on the screen, but we'd also like to use the same size preset for both icons.
We don't want to go to SVG and check how the icon looks like to then decide which icon size to use just to make them look aligned.
That would be a terrible developer experience for components using icons as well.

Setting bounding boxes for the icons is a technique used for controlling the size of the icon relatively to each other.
It allows us to say that all icons live within the same square boundaries, but you can control how your icon is rendered inside of it.
That way you can leave some space around the chevron to make it look smaller than the lightning icon while they're using them in the same way.

This is a great approach but with a potential drawback.
That extra space from the icons goes directly into your components, and it might increase the visual padding from the sides of the component.
You can see it in the 2nd example here:

![Examples of icons using bounding boxes](/img/blog/iconography-1.png)

What I found useful for myself is to keep only vertical spacing of the bounding box but drop the horizontal ones as shown in the 3rd example.
It still lets you control the relative size of the icon without having double horizontal spacing in your components.

This is a very tiny detail which can help you avoid css hacks that you might find across some well-known products like this one:

```css
.specific-button .button-icon {
  margin: 0px 3px 0px -4px;
}
```

## Accessibility

Even though icons are completely static elements — there are couple of things to keep in mind.
First of all, most of the time icons are decorative elements on the page and should be hidden for the screen reader users.
That comes with another requirement — icons shouldn't be used for any interactions.

If you want to add an event listener for the icon on the page — make sure it's wrapped with a button or a link.
That's true not just for click elements, but even for hover events.
Since with the keyboard navigation user can't hover anything on the screen, same action should be triggered on element focus,
and you again need a focusable element for this.
For instance, in Reshaped we recommend rendering interactive icons by using Button component or Actionable utility.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink href="/content/docs/components/button" title="Button" />
  <CrossLink href="/content/docs/utilities/actionable" title="Actionable" />
</Grid>

Since interactive icons are using other component wrappers, Icon utility may rely on those components to provide text labels for assistive technologies.
So when using a button with just an icon in it, don't forget about adding an aria-label to it as well.

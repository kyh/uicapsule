title: Figma plugin

<Image src="/img/docs/figma-setup/figma-plugin.png" />

We've built a Figma plugin that can add themes & switch to dark mode.
It works locally and does it blazingly fast.
It supports theming for color, text, and effects.
Visit <a href="/figma-plugin" target="_blank">our landing page</a> for demo or find it <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1132648122057236517/UICapsule" target="_blank">directly on Figma</a>.

## Why does it exist?

When we first launched the [UICapsule design system](https://@uicapsule/components.so/), it relied on external plugins, but soon enough, the community was reporting that something didn't work or wasn't intuitive enough.
We decided to build a simple plugin that covers the basics, doesn't require complex integration or intricate token setup: open the plugin, sync styles and apply a theme.
That said, we can still recommend other plugins if you're looking for a more specific solution: ["Themer"](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer) and ["Figma Tokens"](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens).

## Here's how it works:

### Add a new theme:

<Image src="/img/docs/figma-setup/theme-demo-1.gif" />

- **Open the plugin in light mode library.** Make sure your styles are published.
- **Sync styles and save.** Don't forget to add your theme name.
- **Repeat for dark mode.** Open another file to sync Dark mode.

### Edit a theme:

<Image src="/img/docs/figma-setup/theme-demo-2.gif" />

Just click an edit button: the flow is the same as adding a new theme.

### Apply a theme:

<Image src="/img/docs/figma-setup/theme-demo-3.gif" />

- Open the plugin in your file and select a frame you want to apply the theme to
- Pick a theme and color mode
- Hit "Reshape"

That's pretty much everything you need to know.
We hope you enjoy using UICapsule!

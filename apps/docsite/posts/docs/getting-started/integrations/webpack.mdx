description: Setting up Reshaped package in a Webpack project.
---

## Create your project

Start by creating a new project using NPM with Webpack and other related dependencies.
We're installing dependencies for a simple project using Typescript with `ts-loader` in the following example.

Dependencies may vary based on the project setup.
For example, you might use `babel-loader` instead of `ts-loader` if you don't use Typescript.

```bash
mkdir my-reshaped-app
cd my-reshaped-app
npm install react react-dom
npm install --dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server css-loader postcss-loader mini-css-extract-plugin ts-loader typescript html-webpack-plugin @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Install Reshaped

Download the latest Reshaped release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/reshaped.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/reshaped.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/reshaped.tgz
```

## Add PostCSS config

Import a PostCSS config from Reshaped and add it to `postcss.config.js` file in the root folder:

```js
const postcss = require("reshaped/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

## Add Webpack configuration

Add all installed Webpack loaders to your Webpack config and set up the config options based on your needs.
You can find an example of a simple Webpack config in our example project:

  />
</Grid>

## Add Typescript config (optional)

If you're using Typescript, add a configuration for it in `tsconfig.json` file.
You can find an example of a simple Typescript config in our example project:

  />
</Grid>

## Start the application

Add NPM scripts to your `package.json` file to start the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
```

Now you can run your build process with `npm run start`.

```bash
npm run start
```

## Start using Reshaped components

Import some of the core components in `src/App.tsx` and try them out:

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "reshaped";
import "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="reshaped">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

You can find more details in our `webpack-starter` example on Github.
If you want to learn more about components - search for the relevant components documentation in the sidebar.

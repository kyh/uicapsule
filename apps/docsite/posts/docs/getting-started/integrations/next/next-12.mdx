## Create your project

Start by creating your Next.js project if you don't have one already.
Using [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#setup) should speed up this process:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-reshaped-app
cd my-reshaped-app
```

Or if you're using Typescript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-reshaped-app --typescript
cd my-reshaped-app
```

## Install Reshaped

Download the latest Reshaped release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/reshaped.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/reshaped.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/reshaped.tgz
```

## Add PostCSS config

Import a PostCSS config from Reshaped and add it to `postcss.config.js` file in the root folder:

```js
const postcss = require("reshaped/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

## Start the application

Run your build process with `npm run dev`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Start using Reshaped components

Import components in `_app.tsx` or any application route and try them out.
Next 12 doesn't support global css imports inside node_modules, so make sure to import components from `reshaped/bundle` to use an already compiled version of the library.

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "reshaped/bundle";
import "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";
import "reshaped/bundle.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="reshaped">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

You can find more details in our `next-starter` example on Github.
If you want to learn more about components - search for the relevant components documentation in the sidebar.

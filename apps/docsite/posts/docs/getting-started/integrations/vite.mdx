---

### Create your project

Start by creating your Vite project if you don't have one already.
Using [Create Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) should speed up this process:

```bash
npm init vite@latest my-reshaped-app --template react
cd my-reshaped-app
```

Or if you're using Typescript:

```bash
npm init vite@latest my-reshaped-app --template react-ts
cd my-reshaped-app
```

### Install Reshaped

Download the latest Reshaped release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/reshaped.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/reshaped.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/reshaped.tgz
```

### Add PostCSS config

Import a PostCSS config from Reshaped and add it to `postcss.config.js` file in the root folder:

```js
const postcss = require("reshaped/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

### Start the application

Run your build process with `npm run dev`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start using Reshaped components

Import some of the core components in `src/App.tsx` and try them out:

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "reshaped";
import reshapedTheme from "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="reshaped">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

You can find more details in our `vite-starter` example on Github.
If you want to learn more about components - search for the relevant components documentation in the sidebar.

description: Setting up UICapsule package in a Create React App project.
---

## Create your project

Start by creating your [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) project if you don't have one already:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```

Or if you're using Typescript:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project --template typescript
cd my-project
```

## Install UICapsule

Download the latest UICapsule release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz
```

## Start the application

Run your build process with `npm run start`.

```bash
npm run start
```

## Start using UICapsule components

Import some of the core components in `src/App.tsx` and try them out:

```code
import { Button, Container, UICapsule } from "@uicapsule/components";
import "@uicapsule/components/themes/@uicapsule/components/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UICapsule theme="uicapsule">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </UICapsule>
  );
};
```

## Add PostCSS config

By default, Create React App doesn't allow customizing the `postcss.config.js` file.
Since UICapsule primarily uses vanilla CSS with CSS Modules, all features provided by UICapsule components work out of the box.
All advanced features like responsive component properties syntax work with the default Create React App setup.

However, if you want to use UICapsule custom media query values, you can create and apply a custom `postcss.config.js` file either by ejecting Create React App or using tools like [Craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco).
That will allow you to import a PostCSS config from UICapsule and add it to the `postcss.config.js` file in the root folder:

```js
const postcss = require("@uicapsule/components/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

You can find more details in our `cra-starter` example on Github.

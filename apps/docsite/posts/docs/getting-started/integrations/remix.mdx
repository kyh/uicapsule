description: Setting up Reshaped package in a Remix project.
---

## Create your project

Start by creating your Remix project if you don't have one already.
Using [Create Remix command](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog) should speed up this process:

```bash
npx create-remix --template remix-run/indie-stack my-reshaped-app
cd my-reshaped-app
```

We're using `indie-stack` template in this example but feel free to pick any other Remix template.

## Install Reshaped

Download the latest Reshaped release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/reshaped.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/reshaped.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/reshaped.tgz
```

## Add Reshaped to the root file

Remix application wrapper is stored in the `app/root.tsx` file.
To make Reshaped styles and context available for all routes, we should make some changes there.

Import Reshaped provider and CSS files.
Note that we're importing component from the `reshaped/bundle` to use an already compiled version of the library.

```ts
import { Reshaped } from "reshaped/bundle";
import theme from "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";
import styles from "reshaped/bundle.css";
```

Add styles to the exported Remix `links` array:

```ts
export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    { rel: "stylesheet", href: styles },
    { rel: "stylesheet", href: theme },
  ];
};
```

Wrap the application with the provider:

```code
<Reshaped theme="reshaped">
  <Outlet />
</Reshaped>
```

## Start using Reshaped components

You can start using Reshaped components anywhere in your application.
Make sure to import them from `reshaped/bundle` to use an already compiled version of the library.

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "reshaped/bundle";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Container width="652px">
      <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
    </Container>
  );
};
```

## Start the application

Run your build process with `npm run dev`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Add PostCSS config

All our components work without PostCSS but in case you need to use our custom media queries available in CSS you'll need a PostCSS setup available in your project.
In that case, check Remix documentation on [how to make it work with PostCSS](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#postcss).

After you're done with the setup, import a PostCSS config from Reshaped and add it to `postcss.config.js` file in the root folder:

```js
const postcss = require("reshaped/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

You can find more details in our `remix-starter` example on Github.
If you want to learn more about components - search for the relevant components documentation in the sidebar.

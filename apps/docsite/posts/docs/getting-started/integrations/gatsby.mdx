description: Setting up Reshaped package in a Gatsby project.
---

## Create your project

Start by creating your Gatsby project if you don't have one already.
Using [Gatsby init](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) should speed up this process:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

## Install Reshaped

Download the latest Reshaped release from the [Releases page](/content/changelog) and save the `.tgz` file into your project.
Then install the package using the file path.
For example, if you save the package as `./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz` in the project root folder, you can run:

```json
// npm
npm install ./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz

// yarn
yarn add ./vendor/@uicapsule/components.tgz
```

## Add PostCSS config

Install `gatsby-plugin-postcss` and add a PostCSS config from Reshaped through its options:

```js
import postcss from "@uicapsule/components/postcss";

const config = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-postcss",
      options: {
        postCssPlugins: postcss.config.plugins,
      },
    },
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Start the application

Run your build process with `npm run develop`.

```bash
npm run develop
```

## Start using Reshaped components

Import some of the core components from `@uicapsule/components/bundle` along with `@uicapsule/components/bundle.css`:

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "@uicapsule/components/bundle";
import "@uicapsule/components/bundle.css";
import @uicapsule/componentsTheme from "@uicapsule/components/themes/@uicapsule/components/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="@uicapsule/components">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

You can find more details in our `gatsby-starter` example on Github.
If you want to learn more about components - search for the relevant components documentation in the sidebar.

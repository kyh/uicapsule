## Download and install

Log in and download the latest package release from the [Releases](/content/changelog/) page.
Then, move the downloaded package to your project and install it with `yarn` or `npm`.

For instance, if you move it to the `/./vendor/@uicapsule/components-v1.0.0.tgz`, you can then install it like any other package:

```shell
# Yarn
yarn add ././vendor/@uicapsule/components-v1.0.0.tgz

# NPM
npm install ././vendor/@uicapsule/components-v1.0.0.tgz
```

### Setup CSS

Reshaped relies on CSS Modules and PostCSS to keep our styles isolated and support custom media queries.
Additionally, we're keeping CSS imports in our JS files to ensure CSS tree-shaking is working.
This way, you will get CSS only for components you're using in the product instead of importing CSS for the whole library.

Start by creating a `postcss.config.js` file in your project root and importing a PostCSS config from Reshaped:

```code
const postcss = require("@uicapsule/components/postcss");
module.exports = postcss.config;
```

Our config enables custom media queries provided by Reshaped, autoprefixer and cssnano for build optimizations.
This config can be extended with your own plugins.

## Public API

Since we're building the package as ES Modules, we don't merge package files into a single bundle.
However, we're explicitly defining which imports should be used during development:

`import { Button } from '@uicapsule/components';`

You should import all components and utilities from the main library entry point.
This type of import works with tree-shaking, so your bundle will only contain the code you use in your product.

<br />

`const config = require('@uicapsule/components/postcss');`

PostCSS config provided by the library.

<br />

`import '@uicapsule/components/themes/@uicapsule/components/theme.css';`

All pre-built themes are stored in the package, and can you can import them from the `themes` folder.
There is no default theme, so your code bundle will only include the themes you import.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink

    href="/content/docs/theming/creating-themes"
  />
</Grid>

<br />

`import { Button } from '@uicapsule/components/bundle';`<br />
`import '@uicapsule/components/bundle.css';`

Pre-built bundles that can be used for the cases when your framework or build tool doesn't support CSS imports inside the ES modules.

### Start using Reshaped

Import some of the components along with the `Reshaped` provider and try them out:

```code
import { Button, Container, Reshaped } from "@uicapsule/components";
import "@uicapsule/components/themes/@uicapsule/components/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="@uicapsule/components">
      <Container width="652px">
        <Button href="/">Get started</Button>
      </Container>
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

We're aiming for the best modern solution - so Reshaped is shipped as ESM build.
So only the components that you're using in your code will stay in your product bundle.
It also means that we keep ES imports and exports in our code, and you have to compile it further with Babel in your project.

### Setup build process

Reshaped supports most popular build tools and frameworks, like Vite or Next.js.
Check detailed guides for their setup in the Integrations sections or look directly for the project starters in our [community repository](https://github.com/@uicapsule/components/community):

## Server side rendering

To avoid style differences between server and browser rendering, add the default `dir` value for RTL/LTR and the `data-rs-theme` attribute on the body element.

```code
// RTL with light mode
<body dir="rtl" data-rs-theme="@uicapsule/components-light">

// LTR with dark mode
<body data-rs-theme="@uicapsule/components-dark">
```

## Source code

Reshaped can be used as a starting point for the teams building their own design systems to skip the implementation of the core features.
Since most design systems have so much in common, this is a huge time saver for companies who don't want to waste time discovering the best practices and learning about pitfalls.

When you get the Pro license, you get the system's code in precisely the same state as we develop it.
It means that you get access to uncompiled code of the components, their Storybook examples which you can run locally, and an extensive test suite.
As you keep changing the source code of the components, you may also easily adjust the tests and examples you need.

### Installation

Download the latest source code archive and unpack it in your local file system.
After navigating into the package folder, run `yarn && yarn lib:start` to start the Storybook examples for the components.

### Testing

You can find tests next to the components and utilities code.
To run the existing test suite, run `yarn lib:test`.

---

With the pro license purchased, you will also receive a year of free updates.
So even after you start changing the original code, you will be able to look into the latest changes and learn their implementation details.
It should help you stay productive with your system development and will help you adopt new components added to Reshaped.

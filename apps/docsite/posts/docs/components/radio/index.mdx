## Usage

Radio component works like native radio buttons, which means you can either use its `value` property to define what will be passed to the form when it's submitted.

```jsx
<Radio name="animal" value="dog" onChange={({ value, name, event }) => {}}>
  Dog
</Radio>
```

Like all native inputs in React, Radio supports controlled and uncontrolled options.
It becomes controlled when you use `checked` property, which means you have to control it with your state.
An uncontrolled variant is used when you use the `defaultChecked` property, which lets you define the default state and allow the browser to control the rest afterward.

**Note:** You shouldn't be using both properties simultaneously, and React will throw a warning if that happens.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Radio name="animalControlled" value="dog" checked={true}>
    Controlled
  </Radio>
  <Radio name="animalUncontrolled" value="cat" defaultChecked={true}>
    Uncontrolled
  </Radio>
</View>
```

Since Radio is an exclusive selection - you can't deselect a checked item unless you select another one with the same `name`.

## States

If there is an error related to the radio field, you can use a `hasError` flag.
Usually, you would do this only when displaying a group of radio buttons, and you can likely use `RadioGroup` component for that instead.

```jsx
<Radio hasError name="animalError" value="dog">
  Dog
</Radio>
```

To make Radio non-interactive, you can use the `disabled` flag.
Like in native radio buttons, it will prevent the `onChange` handler from triggering.

**Note:** Disabled state fades the component content.
Even though it's not required to have a regular contrast ratio for disabled elements, make not to use it over a gray background.

```jsx
<Radio disabled name="animalDisabled" value="dog">
  Dog
</Radio>
```

## Composition

Most of the time, you will be rendering groups of radio buttons, which you can do with the RadioGroup component.
It handles the selection of radio buttons and lets you receive the current value of the group.
At the same time, it doesn't enforce any specific layout, so you're free to use any layout components.

```jsx
<RadioGroup
  name="animalComposition"
  onChange={({ value }) => console.log(value)}
>
  <View gap={3}>
    <Radio value="dog">Dog</Radio>
    <Radio value="cat">Cat</Radio>
  </View>
</RadioGroup>
```

As you can see, `name` and `onChange` properties apply to all Radio components within its scope.
You will get the currently selected value logged into the console by choosing a specific Radio.

In the same way, Radio can define its `checked` value, RadioGroup supports `value` and `defaultValue` to control the selection in the options list.

```jsx
<RadioGroup name="animalValue" defaultValue="cat">
  <View gap={3}>
    <Radio value="dog">Dog</Radio>
    <Radio value="cat">Cat</Radio>
  </View>
</RadioGroup>
```

If you need to provide a label for a group of radio buttons, you can use the `FormControl` utility with the `group` flag turned on.
That will resolve `FormControl` HTML tags correctly for a group of input fields.

```jsx
<FormControl group>
  <FormControl.Label>Favorite animals:</FormControl.Label>

  <RadioGroup name="animalGroup">
    <View gap={3}>
      <Radio value="dog">Dog</Radio>
      <Radio value="cat">Cat</Radio>
    </View>
  </RadioGroup>
</FormControl>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink href="/content/docs/utilities/form-control" title="FormControl" />
</Grid>

Both Radio and RadioGroup support content composition.
Since RadioGroup doesn't provide any markup, you can use it with any layout components.
For the Radio component, you can render multiple elements as its `children`.

```jsx
<RadioGroup name="animalCustom" defaultValue="cat">
  <View gap={3}>
    <Card as="label">
      <View gap={3} direction="row" align="center">
        <Radio value="dog" />
        <View.Item grow>
          <Text variant="body-strong-1">Dog</Text>
          <Text variant="body-2">
            The dog is a domesticated animal of the family Canidae.
          </Text>
        </View.Item>
      </View>
    </Card>

    <Card as="label">
      <View gap={3} direction="row" align="center">
        <Radio value="cat" />
        <View.Item grow>
          <Text variant="body-strong-1">Cat</Text>
          <Text variant="body-2">
            The cat is a domesticated animal of the family Felidae.
          </Text>
        </View.Item>
      </View>
    </Card>
  </View>
</RadioGroup>
```

## Accessibility

- When using Radio without children, wrap it with a label element.

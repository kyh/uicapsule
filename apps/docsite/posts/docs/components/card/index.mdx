## Usage

Cards are empty containers with basic styling applied to them, and they are perfect for the composition of components.

```jsx
<Card>
  <Placeholder />
</Card>
```

Cards are often used as actionable elements, so it supports both `href` and `onClick` properties.
It will automatically use a correct HTML tag for the Card root element to keep it accessible for screen readers.

```jsx
<Card onClick={() => {}}>
  <Placeholder />
</Card>
```

Card supports `selected` state when used for group selection. For example, it can be used with `Checkbox` or `Radio` to highlight their selected state.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(true);

  return (
    <Card as="label" selected={selected}>
      <View gap={3} direction="row" align="center">
        <Checkbox
          value="dog"
          checked={selected}
          onChange={({ checked }) => setSelected(checked)}
          name="animal"
        />
        <View.Item grow>
          <Text variant="body-strong-1">Dog</Text>
          <Text variant="body-2">
            The dog is a domesticated animal of the family Canidae.
          </Text>
        </View.Item>
      </View>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Composition

Card has a default `4x` padding, which you can change to any other multiplier of the base unit token.

```jsx
<Card padding={2}>
  <Placeholder />
</Card>
```

In the same way, you can altogether remove the padding from the Card and let the content take its entire width.
Compare it with the previous example to see the difference.

```jsx
<Card padding={0}>
  <Placeholder />
</Card>
```

After the padding is removed, you can combine full-width content with the `Frame` utility to get the padding back for some parts of the content.
That is handy when you're combining media elements with text content.

```jsx
<View width="50%">
  <Card padding={0}>
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
      <Image src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp" />
    </AspectRatio>
    <View padding={4}>
      Located in a quiet street in hip and happening Amsterdam East near the
      Beukenplein and Oosterpark.
    </View>
  </Card>
</View>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Frame" href="/content/docs/utilities/frame" />
  <CrossLink title="Aspect Ratio" href="/content/docs/utilities/aspect-ratio" />
</Grid>

You can compose multiple card sections together with the Divider component to make it look like a group of cards.

```jsx
<Card padding={0}>
  <View padding={4}>
    <Placeholder />
  </View>
  <Divider />
  <View padding={4}>
    <Placeholder />
  </View>
  <Divider />
  <View padding={4}>
    <Placeholder />
  </View>
</Card>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Divider" href="/content/docs/components/divider" />
</Grid>

## Bleed

There is an opportunity to save space on mobile viewports by making the Card full width.
Card supports `bleed` property to avoid layout complexities that remove side borders and apply the negative margin multiplier you pass to it.
Like most other layout properties, the `bleed` property is responsive, so you can easily control how your Card behaves on every viewport size.

For example, the second Card here uses `x4` bleed on small and medium screens but renders normally for large and extra-large screens.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Card bleed={4}>
    <Placeholder />
  </Card>

  <Card bleed={{ s: 4, l: 0 }}>
    <Placeholder />
  </Card>
</View>
```

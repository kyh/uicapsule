## Usage

Alert is a composition of multiple other components defined by its properties.
You can render title and text content separately and pass an optional `icon` to optionally render it on the side.

```jsx
<Alert title="Update your theme" icon={IconZap}>
  Don't forget to generate the new theme definition after updating to our latest
  release.
</Alert>
```

## Actions

Alert supports rendering one or multiple action elements.
You can pass either a single component or an array of components to the `actionsSlot` property.
Alert automatically adds a standard gap between the passed elemenets.

```jsx
<Alert
  title="Update your theme"
  icon={IconZap}
  actionsSlot={[
    <Link variant="plain">Generate</Link>,
    <Link variant="plain">Skip for now</Link>,
  ]}
>
  Don't forget to generate the new theme definition after updating to our latest
  release.
</Alert>
```

## Colors

Alert comes in 4 different colors with `neutral` being the default one.
Other colors are usually used to convey the status of the page area or promote your content.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Alert title="Unexpected error happened" icon={IconZap} color="critical">
    We have encountered an error while making a request. Please try again later.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="You are all set" icon={IconZap} color="positive">
    We are processing your data but you can already start using our service.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="Release highlights" icon={IconZap} color="primary">
    This release comes with 3 new components that you can start using
    immediately.
  </Alert>
</View>
```

## Layout direction

Alert supports switching layout direction to horizontal with `inline` property.
It can come handy when you want to save content space and/or display Alert actions on the end side.

```jsx
<Alert
  inline
  title="Update your theme"
  icon={IconZap}
  actionsSlot={<Link variant="plain">Generate</Link>}
>
  Don't forget to generate the new theme definition after updating to our latest
  release.
</Alert>
```

Make sure not to use too many actions when using `inline` property since it will leave less space available for the main content area. Ideally there should be just one action in this case.

## Bleed

There is an opportunity to save space on mobile viewports by making the Alert full width.
Alert supports `bleed` property to avoid layout complexities that remove side borders and apply the negative margin multiplier you pass to it.
Like most other layout properties, the `bleed` property is responsive, so you can easily control how your Alert behaves on every viewport size.

For example, the second Alert here uses `x4` bleed on small and medium screens but renders normally for large and extra-large screens.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Alert bleed={4}>
    <Placeholder />
  </Alert>

  <Alert bleed={{ s: 4, l: 0 }}>
    <Placeholder />
  </Alert>
</View>
```

## Accessibility

Alert automatically assigns its role and gets announced by screen readers when it gets rendered on the screen.

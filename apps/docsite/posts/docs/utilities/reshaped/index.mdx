## Usage

Reshaped should be used once by wrapping your whole application to enable our global event listeners and give you access to the Reshaped context hooks.

```code
import { Reshaped } from "reshaped";
import "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return <Reshaped theme="reshaped">My application</Reshaped>;
};
```

Reshaped provider is used to define the root theme of your application.
By passing a theme to the Reshaped provider &mdash; you will enable access to all design tokens available in the design system.

  <CrossLink title="Design tokens" href="/content/docs/tokens/overview" />
</Grid>

## Color mode

By passing `defaultColorMode` to Reshaped provider, you can pick `light` or `dark` color mode to be used by default.

```code
import { Reshaped } from "reshaped";
import "reshaped/themes/reshaped/theme.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Reshaped theme="reshaped" defaultColorMode="dark">
      My application
    </Reshaped>
  );
};
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink
    title="ThemeProvider"
    href="/content/docs/utilities/theme-provider"
  />
  <CrossLink title="useTheme" href="/content/docs/hooks/use-theme" />
</Grid>

## RTL

Reshaped supports RTL text direction and provides a hook to change that dynamically for the whole application.
Reshaped component serves as an entry point to define the default value used in the hook later.

```code
<Reshaped defaultRTL={true} />
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="useRTL" href="/content/docs/hooks/use-rtl" />
</Grid>

## Focus ring management

Reshaped component adds focus management functionality.
It lets components display a focus ring only when an element on the page is focused using the keyboard.
If you want to create your custom focusable component that uses this feature &mdash; use an `Actionable` utility that handles this automatically.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Actionable" href="/content/docs/utilities/actionable" />
  <CrossLink
    title=":focus-visible"
    href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo"
  />
</Grid>

## Usage

Container should be used as a wrapper for your main content.
It provides the content with max-width for larger screens and adds horizontal paddings for mobile.
You can use it to center page content horizontally or within other components e.g., centering contents of the page header.

```code
<Container>
  <Placeholder />
</Container>
```

By default, Container takes the entire width of the parent.
It supports the `width` property, which accepts any string value so that you can use it with `px`, `%`, or any other valid CSS measurement.

```code
<Container width="1024px">
  <Placeholder />
</Container>
```

By default, Container has horizontal padding of `x4` units, but you can customize it by using the `padding` property.
For example, if you use Container to center content inside another component that already has its padding - you can completely remove it.

```code
<ActionBar>
  <Container width="1024px" padding={0}>
    Your content
  </Container>
</ActionBar>
```

## Usage

ThemeProvider is mainly used to create scoped themes.
Scoped themes are themes applied only to a specific part of the page.
For example, they can be used to create social media share buttons using our Button component.

To achieve this, you can create a custom theme using our Theming CLI and then pass that theme to the ThemeProvider.

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme="twitter">
  <Button color="primary" rounded>
    Share
  </Button>
</ThemeProvider>
```

You can find more about how to create your custom themes in our Scoped theming documentation:

<Grid>
  <CrossLink
    title="Scoped theming"
    href="/content/docs/theming/scoped-theming"
  />
  <CrossLink title="useTheme" href="/content/docs/hooks/use-theme" />
</Grid>

## Color mode

In Reshaped, we don't treat light and dark modes like two different themes.
Instead, we have a separate `colorMode` definition.

It's applied on the top level of the application for all its themes.
However, sometimes components might be using dark backgrounds in light mode and vice versa.
To avoid supporting `inverted` color tokens for every theme and increase the theme CSS size, we allow inverting the current mode in runtime with the `ColorMode` utility.

```jsx
<View gap={3} direction="row">
  <Card>I am using the current color mode</Card>
  <ThemeProvider colorMode="inverted">
    <Card>I am using the inverted color mode</Card>
  </ThemeProvider>
</View>
```

Same as inverting the currently used color mode, you can pick `dark` or `light` mode to be used all the time.

```jsx
<ThemeProvider colorMode="dark">
  <Card>I am using dark mode all the time</Card>
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Usage

When `src` is valid and loads correctly, Image component renders an img element as if it was rendered natively with `auto` width and height.
With the default browser behaviour that's likely to result in **suboptimal quality** on retina screens:

```jsx
<Image src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp" alt="Canyon rock" />
```

To improve the quality, make sure to either define the image size manually or use `srcSet` attribute.
Note that we pass different image assets here for different pixel densities and browser will automatically pick which one to download:

```jsx
<Image
  src="/img/examples/image.webp"
  alt="Canyon rock"
  imageAttributes={{ srcSet: "/img/examples/image-retina.webp 2x" }}
/>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink
    title="MDN: Responsive images"
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images"
  />
</Grid>

You can pick the correct `borderRadius` for the Image based on the design tokens to better visually align it with the surrounding components.
For circular images, `Avatar` component can be used instead.

```jsx
<Image
  src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp"
  alt="Canyon rock"
  borderRadius="large"
  width="300px"
/>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Avatar" href="/content/docs/components/avatar" />
</Grid>

## Sizes

You can pass a specific `width` and `height` to the Image to easier control how it's used in the layout.
These values work with any CSS values and support responsive syntax, which means you can change the Image size per viewport.

```jsx
<Image
  src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp"
  alt="Canyon rock"
  width={{ s: "200px", l: "300px" }}
  height={{ s: "calc(var(--rs-unit-x1) * 20)", l: "100%" }}
/>
```

Another way to define the Image size is to use it together with `AspectRatio` utility.
In that case `AspectRatio` will define the Image sizes based on the passed ratio value and will apply `cover` display mode by default.

```jsx
<AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
  <Image
    src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp"
    alt="Canyon rock"
    width="300px"
  />
</AspectRatio>
```

## Fallback

Image provides multiple `fallback` options that are shown based on the sizes defined for the image-retina.
Using them is helpful whenever and error happens during the Image load or `src` is not available in your data source.
In both cases you might want to show a placeholder.

When `fallback` is passed as a boolean, Image will just render a background.

```jsx
<View width="300px">
  <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
    <Image fallback />
  </AspectRatio>
</View>
```

When `fallback` is passed as a string, Image will use it as a URL for a fallback image-retina.
In this case another image will try loading instead of the original one.

```jsx
<Image
  width="80px"
  height="80px"
  fallback="/img/examples/placeholder.webp"
  borderRadius="medium"
/>
```

When `fallback` is passed as ReactNode, it will be used as a slot to render any component.
For example, it can be used to render placeholder icons or error messages.

```jsx
<Image
  width="80px"
  height="80px"
  fallback={<Icon svg={IconZap} size={6} />}
  borderRadius="medium"
/>
```

Note that `fallback` won't be visible if Image doesn't have its sizes defined or is not using `AspectRatio`.

## Accessibility

We recommend using `alt` property for most of the images as long as you have a way to provide meaningful description for the screen reader users.
If `alt` is not passed, Image will be treated as decorative and will use `presentation` role.

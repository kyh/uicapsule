description: Typography tokens are used for consistent display of text content and its scaling across viewports.

```preview
<Text variant="display-2">Display 2</Text>
```

UICapsule supports a variety of tokens controlling the text content styles like font size, line height, etc.
They're grouped and are exposed for product use through the `Text` utility component.

Typography changes token values responsively based on the viewport, so you don't have to take care of that yourself.
For example, try resizing your browser and check the `display-2` example above.

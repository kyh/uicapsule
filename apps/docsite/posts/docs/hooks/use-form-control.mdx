title: useFormControl
description: Custom hook to inherit values from the FormControl utility in your custom-built form fields.
---

<br />
<br />

## Usage

```ts
import { useFormControl } from "@uicapsule/components";
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Form Control" href="/content/docs/utilities/form-control" />
</Grid>

When using `FormControl` utility – you would usually pass properties to it that should also affect your form field.
For instance, passing the `disabled` flag to `FormControl` should also change the field color and prevent the user from interacting with it.

If you're using Reshaped form field components – they are already using `useFormControl` inside them, so this logic is supported automatically.
However, if you're building a custom input component, `useFormControl` is where you can get data for inheriting the FormControl properties values.

For instance, you can create a custom input component with the hook:

```tsx
function CustomInputComponent() {
  const { disabled } = useFormControl();

  return <input type="text" disabled={disabled} />;
}
```

Then it will automatically get access to values used in the FormControl your input is wrapped with:

```code
<FormControl disabled>
  <FormControl.Label>Custom field:</FormControl.Label>
  <CustomInputComponent />
</FormControl>
```

## Arguments and return value

```ts
() => ({
  attributes: object,
  required: boolean,
  hasError: boolean,
  hasSuccess: boolean,
  disabled: boolean,
});
```

## Usage

Form fields have a required `name` property, so that's the only property you have to pass to Switch to start using it.
If you need to handle its change events, add an `onChange` property to it.

```jsx
<Switch name="showAvatar" onChange={console.log} />
```

## Controlled/Uncontrolled

Same as when using native inputs in React, Switch can be used as a controlled or uncontrolled component.
By default, Switch is uncontrolled and lets you define its default state using the `defaultChecked` property.
In this case, all change events are handled automatically.

```jsx
<Switch name="showAvatar" defaultChecked={true} />
```

If you need to control the state of the field manually, you can use the `value` property.
That will give you complete control of the component value and will stop handling the value automatically.
You will have to update the state using the `onChange` handler and will be able to add custom logic before that happens.

```jsx
<Switch
  name="showAvatar"
  checked
  onChange={({ value }) => {
    /* Update your state here */
  }}
/>
```

## States

To make Switch non-interactive, you can use the `disabled` flag.
Like in native checkbox fields, it will prevent the `onChange` handler from triggering.

```jsx
<Switch name="showAvatar" disabled />
```

## Usage

Loader is usually used as part of other components to enable loading state for them but can still be used as a standalone element.

```jsx
<Loader />
```

## Sizes

- `small` Loader size is the default size and is used with small-sized components like `Button`.
- `medium` Loader size is to be used for larger components or page sections.

```jsx
<View gap={3} direction="row">
  <Loader size="small" />
  <Loader size="medium" />
</View>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Button" href="/content/docs/components/button" />
</Grid>

Loader supports responsive syntax for its `size` property, which means you can change its width based on the viewport.

```jsx
<Loader size={{ s: "small", m: "medium" }} />
```

## Colors

Loader is coming in `primary` color but can also `inherit` its color from the parent element text color.

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    background: "var(--uic-color-black)",
    color: "var(--uic-color-white)",
    padding: 8,
  }}
>
  <Loader color="inherit" />
</div>
```

## Accessibility

If you need to announce the spinner action to the screen reader users, you can use `aria-label` attribute.
It will also add `aria-live` attribute to the Loader to make sure that status changes are announced.

```code
<Loader attributes={{ 'aria-label': 'Loading results' }} />
```

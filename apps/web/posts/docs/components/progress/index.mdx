## Usage

Progress is controlled by the `value` property, which will define the width of the bar.
By default, it works within the 0-100 boundaries, which means that passing `value={50}` will make the bar cover half of the component width.

```jsx
<Progress value={50} />
```

You can control these `min` and `max` boundaries in case you're working with value data sets that, for example, don't start at 0.

```jsx
<Progress value={75} min={50} max={100} />
```

## Sizes

Progress comes in 2 sizes, `medium` (default) and `small`.

- `medium` size is usually used for standalone progress or score bars.
- `small` progress bar can be easily embedded into groups of elements, like in media players.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Progress value={50} />
  <Progress value={50} size="small" />
</View>
```

## Colors

Progress supports `primary` (default), `critical`, `positive`, and `white` colors to be used in different contexts.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Progress value={50} color="primary" />
  <Progress value={50} color="critical" />
  <Progress value={50} color="positive" />
</View>
```

`white` progress bar stays white in both light and dark mode and is perfect for displaying progress on top of media content.
For instance, you can use it for the video or audio player.

```jsx
<View width="300px" maxWidth="100%" overflow="hidden" borderRadius="medium">
  <Overlay
    backgroundSlot={
      <Image src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp" alt="Static media example" />
    }
    position="bottom"
  >
    <Progress value={50} color="white" size="small" />
  </Overlay>
</View>
```

## Duration

When using Progres to display the timeout value, you can pass custom `duration` to it.
That will help you run the animation purely with CSS and without calculating and updating the value in your React code.

```jsx
function DurationExample() {
  const [active, setActive] = React.useState(false);

  const handleChange = () => {
    setActive((state) => !state);
  };

  return (
    <View gap={3}>
      <View.Item>
        <Button onClick={handleChange}>Change value</Button>
      </View.Item>
      <Progress value={active ? 100 : 0} duration={5000} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

- Progress should be labelled either by passing `aria-labelledby` attribute to it pointing to a text label or with `aria-label` attribute.
- By default, Progress uses a `scorebar` role.
  If you're using Progress with a different context like score bars, you can manually change this role by passing a role attribute with the `attributes` property.

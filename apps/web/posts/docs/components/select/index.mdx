## Usage

Form fields have a required `name` property, so that's the only property you have to pass to Select to start using it.
If you need to handle its change events - add an `onChange` property to it.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  onChange={(args) => console.log(args)}
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
/>
```

## Controlled/Uncontrolled

Same as when using native inputs in React, Select can be used as a controlled or uncontrolled component.
By default, Select is uncontrolled and lets you define its default value using the `defaultValue` property.
In this case, all change events are handled automatically.
This approach is helpful when you're populating the field default value from a data source, but you don't need to control it manually afterward.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal2"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  defaultValue="dog"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
/>
```

If you need to control the state of the field manually, you can use the `value` property.
That will give you complete control of the component value and will stop handling the value automatically.
You will have to update the state using the `onChange` handler and will be able to add custom logic before that happens.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal3"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  onChange={({ value }) => {
    /* Update your state here */
  }}
  value="dog"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
/>
```

## Slots

Select supports a content slot on the left side, which you can use for displaying text or other components.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal6"
  placeholder="Select account"
  options={[
    { label: "hello@@uicapsule/components.so", value: "1" },
    { label: "updates@@uicapsule/components.so", value: "2" },
  ]}
  startSlot={
    <Avatar
      src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1096029593335676929/OZbE9ZXV_400x400.png"
      initials="D"
      size={4}
    />
  }
/>
```

## Icon support

For consistent Icon usage in text fields, you can use the `icon` property instead of `startSlot` and pass the icon SVG component.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
  icon={IconZap}
/>
```

## Sizes

Select comes in 3 sizes, with the `medium` size used by default.
All sizes are aligned with sizes of other related components like `Button` or `TextField`.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Select
    size="medium"
    name="animal"
    placeholder="Select an animal"
    options={[
      { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
      { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
    ]}
    icon={IconZap}
  />
  <Select
    size="large"
    name="animal"
    placeholder="Select an animal"
    options={[
      { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
      { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
    ]}
    icon={IconZap}
  />
  <Select
    size="xlarge"
    name="animal"
    placeholder="Select an animal"
    options={[
      { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
      { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
    ]}
    icon={IconZap}
  />
</View>
```

Select supports responsive syntax for its `size` property, which means you can change its size based on the viewport.

```jsx
<Select
  size={{ s: "medium", l: "xlarge" }}
  name="animal"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
  icon={IconZap}
/>
```

## States

You can use `hasError` property to show the user that Select is not passing the form validation.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal4"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  hasError
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
/>
```

Select can be disabled with the `disabled` flag.
Remember that disabling the field will remove it from the form submit query.

```jsx
<Select
  disabled
  name="animal5"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
/>
```

## Using with FormControl

To let the user know what data you expect them to type in, add labels or status messages to your fields with the help of the `FormControl` utility.
In case you're using `xlarge` Select size, you can also combine it with the `large` FormControl size for better visual alignment.

**Note:** Don't use placeholders as labels for the fields as users won't see the placeholder when input contains a value.

```jsx
<FormControl>
  <FormControl.Label>Email</FormControl.Label>
  <Select
    name="animal7"
    placeholder="Select an animal"
    options={[
      { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
      { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
    ]}
  />
</FormControl>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink href="/content/docs/utilities/form-control" title="FormControl" />
</Grid>

## Accessibility

- When using Select - make sure to provide a text description for it.
  You can either provide the label by using the `FormControl` utility or by passing `inputAttributes={{ 'aria-label': 'Your label' }}` to the component if you don't want to display it visually.

```jsx
<Select
  name="animal8"
  placeholder="Select an animal"
  options={[
    { label: "Dog", value: "dog" },
    { label: "Turtle", value: "turtle" },
  ]}
  inputAttributes={{ "aria-label": "Animal" }}
/>
```

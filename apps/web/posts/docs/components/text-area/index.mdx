## Usage

Form fields have a required `name` property, so that's the only property you have to pass to TextArea to start using it.
If you need to handle its change events - add an `onChange` property to it.

```jsx
<TextArea
  name="email"
  placeholder="Enter your email"
  onChange={(args) => console.log(args)}
/>
```

## Controlled/Uncontrolled

Same as when using native inputs in React, TextArea can be used as a controlled or uncontrolled component.
By default, TextArea is uncontrolled and lets you define its default value using the `defaultValue` property.
In this case, all change events are handled automatically.
This approach is helpful when you're pre-filling a form from a data source, but you don't need to control the further behavior of the input.

```jsx
<TextArea
  name="email"
  placeholder="your.email@gmail.com"
  defaultValue="@uicapsule/components.example@gmail.com"
/>
```

If you need to control the state of the field manually, you can use the `value` property.
That will give you complete control of the component value and will stop handling the value automatically.
You will have to update the state using the `onChange` handler and will be able to add custom logic before that happens.

```jsx
<TextArea
  name="email"
  placeholder="your.email@gmail.com"
  value="@uicapsule/components.example@gmail.com"
  onChange={({ value }) => {
    /* Update your state here */
  }}
/>
```

## Sizes

TextArea comes in 3 sizes, with the `medium` size used by default.
All sizes are aligned with the paddings of other input components like `TextField` or `Select`.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <TextArea name="desc" size="medium" placeholder="Enter the description" />
  <TextArea name="desc" size="large" placeholder="Enter the description" />
  <TextArea name="desc" size="xlarge" placeholder="Enter the description" />
</View>
```

TextField supports responsive syntax for its `size` property, which means you can change its size based on the viewport.

```jsx
<TextArea
  name="desc"
  size={{ s: "medium", l: "xlarge" }}
  placeholder="Enter the description"
/>
```

## States

You can use `hasError` property to show the user that TextArea is not passing the form validation.

```jsx
<TextArea name="desc" hasError />
```

You can disable TextArea with the `disabled` flag.
However, remember that disabling the field will remove it from the form submit query.

```jsx
<TextArea name="desc" disabled />
```

## Using with FormControl

To let the user know what data you expect them to type in, add labels or status messages to your fields with the help of the `FormControl` utility.
In case you're using `xlarge` TextArea size, you can also combine it with the `large` FormControl size for better visual alignment.

**Note:** Don't use placeholders as labels for the fields as users won't see the placeholder when input contains a value.

```jsx
<FormControl>
  <FormControl.Label>Email</FormControl.Label>
  <TextArea name="name" placeholder="example@gmail.com" />
</FormControl>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink href="/content/docs/utilities/form-control" title="FormControl" />
</Grid>

## Accessibility

- When using TextArea without a label - make sure to provide a text description.
  You can either provide the label by using the `FormControl` utility or by passing `inputAttributes={{ 'aria-label': 'Your label' }}` to the component if you don't want to display it visually.

```jsx
<TextArea attributes={{ "aria-label": "Description" }} />
```

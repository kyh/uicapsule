function Example() {
  const id = useElementId();
  return id;
}
```

<Highlight>Provides unique ids for the page accessibility attributes</Highlight>

## Usage

```ts
import { useElementId } from "@uicapsule/components";
```

When building interfaces, you'll see a lot of cases when you need to link elements together with an id, especially for implementing accessibility-related features.
Those ids are global, and there is always a risk of getting a conflict in a large application.
UIC exposes the `useElementId` hook to avoid id conflicts, which is suited specifically for the DOM elements and supports server-side rendering.

```js
function Component(props) {
  const id = useElementId();
  return <div id={id} />;
}
```

Since hooks can't be used conditionally, `useElementId` supports working with random and manually defined ids.
If your component has an optional id property, you can pass it along to `useElementId,` and it will either use the passed id if it's defined or generate a random one.

```js
const id = useElementId(props.id);
```

**Note:** `useElementId` generates simple ids using an internal counter.
Don't use it for any business logic where you need to generate a truly unique id that stays the same across multiple page renders.

## Arguments and return value

```ts
(id?: string) => id: string
```

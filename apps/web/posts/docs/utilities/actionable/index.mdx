## Usage

Actionable utility takes care of the decisions you have to make when building buttons, links, or any other interactive elements.
It renders the correct HTML tag based on the passed props and handles a variety of states interactive elements may have.

Try clicking the component and then press `Tab` to focus on the next one:

```jsx
<View direction="row" gap={3}>
  <Actionable onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}>Click me</Actionable>
  <Actionable onClick={() => {}}>Focus me</Actionable>
</View>
```

Remember that the `onClick` handler is triggered with either mouse or keyboard event.

## Using as a link

When `href` is passed to the component - it will automatically turn Actionable into an `<a>` tag.
It may still receive onClick like in the button example, which will prevent the default event behavior in that case.

```jsx
<Actionable href="#">Navigate to the top</Actionable>
```

**Note:** Don't use `disabled` or `type` props when rendering `Actionable` as a link.
Native HTML links can't be disabled, and their `href` attribute will work before JS has loaded even if you use `preventDefault()` in the handler.

## Accessibility

Actionable automatically handles its focused state and shows it only when you're navigating to it with the keyboard.

When used only with the `href` property - it's rendered as a link and supports the `Enter` keyboard event.
When used with `onClick` handler or with `attributes={{ role: 'button' }}` - it's rendered as a button and supports both, `Space` and `Enter` keyboard events.

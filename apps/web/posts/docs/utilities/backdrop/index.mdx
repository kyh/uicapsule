## Usage

Backdrop is a controlled component which means that it has an `active` property and multiple handlers that you can use to change the value of this property.
Once Backdrop is active &mdash; it will prevent scrolling of the whole page and only support scrolling for the content displayed inside the Backdrop.

**Note:** It's safe to keep Backdrop in your render all the time.
Backdrop will be rendered in the DOM only if it is active.
Rendering Backdrop optionally will prevent its animation from working.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const { active, activate, deactivate } = useToggle(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={activate}>Open backdrop</Button>
      <Backdrop active={active} onClose={deactivate}>
        Backdrop content
      </Backdrop>
    </>
  );
}
```

Backdrop component is animated, so if you want your children animated together with Backdrop, you can use the render props pattern from React.
With this approach, the `children` property is used as a function that returns an `active` flag.
You can use this flag to set the state of the Backdrop content.

```jsx
function ExampleRenderProps() {
  const { active, activate, deactivate } = useToggle(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={activate}>Open backdrop</Button>
      <Backdrop active={active} onClose={deactivate}>
        {({ active }) => (active ? "Active content" : "Hidden content")}
      </Backdrop>
    </>
  );
}
```

To make it easier to control the state, we're providing a `useToggle` hook that you can use together with Backdrop or other components that toggle states.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="useToggle" href="/content/docs/hooks/use-toggle" />
</Grid>

## Accessibility

- Backdrop traps focus inside its root element, which means that using any type of keyboard navigation will keep the focus inside the Backdrop while it's opened.
- Backdrop triggers its `onClose` handler on `Esc` key press.

<Demo>
  {(props) => `
<View width="300px" maxWidth="100%">
  <Dismissible ${props.base.attributes}>
    ${props.base.children}
  </Dismissible>
</View>
`}
</Demo>

<Highlight>Works with any content</Highlight>

## Usage

Dismissible provides a `children` slot with a reserved spot for the close button.

```jsx
<Dismissible closeAriaLabel="Close banner">
  <Placeholder />
</Dismissible>
```

Dismissible has a `media` variant for displaying media content that can be removed from the screen.
It will move the close button away from the edges of the media content and will use a different variant of the button.

```jsx
<Dismissible variant="media" closeAriaLabel="Close banner">
  <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
    <Image src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp" width="100%" />
  </AspectRatio>
</Dismissible>
```

If you want to hide the close button conditionally, we're providing a `hideCloseButton` property. That should help you simplify the conditional rendering implementation.

```jsx
<Dismissible hideCloseButton>Dismissible content</Dismissible>
```

## Composition

In components like `Modal` or `Popover`, you would usually like to display its title with Dismissible but make the rest of the content full width.
To achieve that, you can group Dismissible with other components.

```jsx
<View gap={3}>
  <Dismissible>
    <Text variant="body-strong-1">View title</Text>
  </Dismissible>
  View content
</View>
```

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Modal" href="/content/docs/components/modal" />
  <CrossLink title="Popover" href="/content/docs/components/popover" />
</Grid>

## Accessibility

- When using Dismissible with a close button, you should also provide the `closeAriaLabel` value to make the close button accessible.

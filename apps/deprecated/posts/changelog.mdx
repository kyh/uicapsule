## Accordion utility

We've shipped a new [Accordion](/content/docs/utilities/accordion) utility for toggling visibility of the content areas with automatic support of its height animation.
It supports any type as content as well as it lets you use any component as a trigger.

```preview
<View height="120px" width="300px" maxWidth="100%">
  <Accordion>
    <Accordion.Trigger>
      <Placeholder />
    </Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content>
      <View paddingTop={4}>
        <Placeholder />
      </View>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion>
</View>
```

## Interactive component demos

Components documentation have received an update with updated demo sections.
Instead of showing static examples of how components look like, documentation now includes interactive knobs for trying out different combination of component properties values.
That should help you see how component behaves without reading the whole article.

Check out the components documentation to see it in action. For example, you can start with a [Button component](/content/docs/components/button) as an example of component with many different visual properties.

## Next.js v13 support

With the v13 being released now, Next.js supports a new way to build routes with the `app` directory.
One of the changes relevant for UI development that happened there was introduction of global css imports support inside node_modules folder.
That means that UICapsule now works with Next without any webpack config customisations or additional plugins.

In this release, we've added a few improvements to align with the changes introduced in the latest Next.js major and have published a new starter example for Next.js 13, as well as we have updated its integration docs.

<Release version="1.7.0" date="2022-10-07" />

## View utility

```preview
<View width="200px" maxWidth="100%" gap={2}>
  <View direction="row" gap={2} align="center">
    <View
      width="32px"
      height="32px"
      borderRadius="medium"
      backgroundColor="primary"
    />
    <View.Item grow>
      <View height="12px" backgroundColor="neutral" borderRadius="medium" />
    </View.Item>
  </View>
  <View direction="row" gap={2} align="center">
    <View
      width="32px"
      height="32px"
      borderRadius="medium"
      backgroundColor="primary"
    />
    <View.Item grow>
      <View height="12px" backgroundColor="neutral" borderRadius="medium" />
    </View.Item>
  </View>
</View>
```

Looking at the different ways of how `Stack` and `Frame` utilities can be used, we have noticed that in many cases both of them are used together.
`Stack` is solving the layout challenges, while `Frame` allows us to easily access design tokens for typical styles.
Additionaly, they both have overlaps in terms of what they provide from the flex api.

To avoid producing more markup than needed and simplify the structure of the codebases using UICapsule, we are introducing a new utility, called `View`.
It supports functionality from both `Stack` and `Frame`, and provides more flexibility for how its properties can be combined, including full responsive syntax support for its layout properties.
Additionally, we've madded some improvements to the `View` API:

- `View.Item` supports a `gapBefore` property, which is called `gap` in `Stack.Item`
- `View.Item` supports a `columns` property, which is called `size` in `Stack.Item`
- `gapBefore` now respects `View.Item` columns property, keeping multi-column layout predictable
- `backgroundColor` now supports `black` value, that stays black in light and dark mode

Being the most low-level utility component, `View` is probaly going to be the most used component in your interfaces when using UICapsule.
You can find information about the `View` API on its [documentation page](/content/docs/utilities/view).

`Stack` and `Frame` utilities are still available in the library and are now using `View` under the hood.
They're going to be dropped in the next major release.

## Updated documentation

We are on a path to make our documentation even more interactive and contextual.
With this release, we have revamped structure of all our component pages:

- We've split content into two tabs, providing a quick access to the properties table for every component
- For `ActionBar` we've created another tab called Examples, showcasing different composition approaches for the component.
  We plan to do the same for all other components once we see how well `ActionBar` examples work for our users.
- Each component now has a card with meta information, that previously was a part of the content and a link to its Storybook files, providing access to even more advanced examples and edge cases.
- All Storybook files now have decorators for components, explaining the expected behaviour of every example

## Other improvements

- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Added new `inherit` color support for `ghost` variant to dynamically switch button color based on the context
- [TextArea](/content/docs/components/text-area): Updated disabled value color to align it with `TextField`
- [Toast](/content/docs/components/toast): Improved focus trapping to return focus back to the trigger element only if focus is still inside the toast
- [Toast](/content/docs/components/toast): Updated actions to use new `inherit` button color when possible
- Rewritten keyboard mode to vanilla javascript to avoid additional rerenders

<Release version="1.6.0" date="2022-09-19" />

## Toast component

We've shipped a new [Toast](/content/docs/components/toast) component for displaying notification messages or other pieces of information above the page content.
As always, we're focusing on the quality of the component and how flexible it is when comes to building custom layouts.
Try out the following preview to see how it works or check its documentation to see all the supported features.

```preview
function Preview() {
  const toast = useToast();

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => toast.show({ text: 'Account created', icon: IconZap })}
    >
      Create an account
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Responsive properties

We've gone through all components and added support for responsive properties for the layout properties that were not supported before.
With the new properties, you can now make every single piece of layout responsive without writing any additional wrapper components.

For example, you can make a responsive action bar with buttons changing their direction and size for mobile screens.
Try resizing your browser to see how it changes its layout as you switch to movile viewport size:

```jsx
<View direction={{ s: "column", m: "row" }} justify="end" gap={2}>
  <Button
    size={{ s: "large", m: "medium" }}
    color="primary"
    fullWidth={{ s: true, m: false }}
  >
    Confirm
  </Button>
  <Button size={{ s: "large", m: "medium" }} fullWidth={{ s: true, m: false }}>
    Cancel
  </Button>
</View>
```

The full list of newly added responsives properties includes:

- [AspectRatio](/content/docs/utilities/aspect-ratio): Added responsive `ratio` support
- [Avatar](/content/docs/components/avatar): Added responsive `size` support
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Added responsive `size` and `fullWidth` support
- [Icon](/content/docs/utilities/icon): Added responsive `size` support
- [Loader](/content/docs/components/loader): Added responsive `size` support
- [MenuItem](/content/docs/components/menu-item): Added responsive `size` and `roundedCorners` support
- [Modal](/content/docs/components/modal): Added responsive `position` and `size` support

## Pro license pricing update

We want to make our pricing more accessible for small and medium-sized companies, as well as to cause less confusion when it comes to deciding on the purchase of UICapsule.
Therefore, we've decided to simplify our Pro license pricing and make it a one-time payment, similar to the regular license.

Purchasing a Pro license will give you lifetime access to the source code, testing, and Storybook setup, as well as unlimited seats for the library.
All companies, who've purchased the Pro license using the previous pricing model, get automatically migrated to the new lifetime access with this release.

## Other improvements

- [ActionBar](/content/docs/components/action-bar): Updated `large` size padding to change starting with `l` viewport
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Relaxed props types and replaced them with runtime checks instead
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Fixed outline button styles when used with white color
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added shadow tokens support
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added transparent border support

- [Modal](/content/docs/components/modal): Fixed scrolling inside the `bottom` position modal when content overflows the height of the screen
- Aligned the name of the keyboard mode attribute with other global data attributes

<Release version="1.5.0" date="2022-08-31" />

## Breadcrumbs component

We've shipped a new [Breadcrumbs](/content/docs/components/breadcrumbs) component for displaying top-level product navigation.
Components like breadcrumbs have a specific product purpose, so to still keep it white-label and not make any product decisions, it supports rendering any component as a child and lets you control how its collapsing should work.

```preview
<Breadcrumbs defaultVisibleItems={2} color="primary">
  <Breadcrumbs.Item onClick={() => {}}>Catalog</Breadcrumbs.Item>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item onClick={() => {}}>Shoes</Breadcrumbs.Item>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item onClick={() => {}}>Running</Breadcrumbs.Item>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item>Ultraboost</Breadcrumbs.Item>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

## Design system interviews

We've launched a new umbrella website for our design system studio called [Formaat](https://formaat.design).
Our website is a place that connects all of our products together and we also want to use it as a platform to help teams working on design system grow.
We start with a series of [design system interviews](https://formaat.design/interviews) with the industry experts to help you learn about how design systems are built and maintained at scale.

<Image src="https://formaat.design/img/share.png" bordered />

## Core development concepts

To help you work with UICapsule React components, we've added a new [Core concepts](/content/docs/getting-started/react/core-concepts) article, explaining ideas that apply to the whole system.
We cover topics like, responsive component properties, accessibility, utility components and other concepts that turn a component library into the design system.

## Other improvements

- Improved `className` property across all components with an array syntax, where you can pass multiple classes, as well working with conditionals.

```code
// Pass conditional as a className without handling it outside
<View className={foo && 'foo'} />

// Pass arrays of classNames and we will resolve them for you
<View className={['foo', bar && 'bar']} />
```

- Updated [UICapsule components demo](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1086981007887138777) with overview of all components we have in the library
- [ActionBar](/content/docs/components/action-bar): Added Figma examples
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Improved handling of icon colors when switching between variants in Figma
- [Link](/content/docs/components/link): Added `disabled` property support even when component is used as an `<a>` tag
- [Text](/content/docs/utilities/text): Added support for passing `neutral` color explicitly without having to pass `undefined`

<Release version="1.4.0" date="2022-08-10" />

## Carousel component

We've shipped a new [Carousel](/content/docs/components/carousel) component for displaying scollable areas with grouped content.
It works with any type of content, properly handles RTL and supports responsive layouts.

```preview
<View padding={2}>
  <Carousel visibleItems={{ s: 2, l: 3 }}>
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 8, right: 8 }}>
        <Button startIcon={IconHeart} color="white" elevated rounded />
      </div>
      <Image src="/img/examples/architecture-1.webp" alt="Archirecture design" borderRadius="medium" />
    </AspectRatio>
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 8, right: 8 }}>
        <Button startIcon={IconHeart} color="white" elevated rounded />
      </div>
      <Image src="/img/examples/architecture-2.webp" alt="Archirecture design" borderRadius="medium" />
    </AspectRatio>
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 8, right: 8 }}>
        <Button startIcon={IconHeart} color="white" elevated rounded />
      </div>
      <Image src="/img/examples/architecture-3.webp" alt="Archirecture design" borderRadius="medium" />
    </AspectRatio>

        <Button startIcon={IconHeart} color="white" elevated rounded />
      </div>
      <Image src="/img/examples/architecture-4.webp" alt="Archirecture design" borderRadius="medium" />
    </AspectRatio>
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 8, right: 8 }}>
        <Button startIcon={IconHeart} color="white" elevated rounded />
      </div>
      <Image src="/img/examples/architecture-5.webp" alt="Archirecture design" borderRadius="medium" />
    </AspectRatio>
  </Carousel>
</View>
```

## Other improvements

<Release version="1.3.0" date="2022-07-23" />

☝️ In case you have custom themes built with UICapsule, you'll have to run their build script once to make sure the typography fixes are applied.

## Figma plugin release

<Image src="/img/docs/figma-setup/figma-plugin.png" />

We've built a Figma plugin that can add themes & switch to dark mode.
It works locally and does it blazingly fast.
It supports theming for color, text, and effects.
Visit <a href="/figma-plugin" target="_blank">our landing page</a> for demo or find it <a href="#" target="_blank">directly on Figma</a>.

## Public Storybook

<Image src="/img/releases/1.3.0/storybook.png" />

Our internal Storybook is finally public for everyone and is now featured in [Storybook Encyclopedia](https://storybook.js.org/showcase/@uicapsule/components-@uicapsule/components).
It might give you a better understanding of our internal development setup in case you're looking to purchase our Pro license.

### Other improvements

- [Alert](/content/docs/components/alert): Added `bleed` support for assigning negative margins
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Fixed endIcon display when both icons are passed simultaneously
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Fixed minimum size values when used in themes with smaller font sizes
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu), [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover): Fixed page scrolling to the top when rendering component as active by default
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu), [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover), [Tooltip](/content/docs/components/tooltip): Fixed animation direction when calculating content position
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu), [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover): Fixed an issue with `active` state getting locked after switching a scoped theme
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` responsive syntax support
- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): Fixed edge cases when dividers were rendered with incorrect index
- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Fixed selected state property in Figma in the elevated variant
- [Text](/content/docs/utilities/text): Added responsive `align` support
- [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field), [TextArea](/content/docs/components/text-area), [Select](/content/docs/components/select): Updated font-size to increase 16px only for touch devices

<Release version="1.2.0" date="2022-06-15" />

## Image utility

```preview
<View direction="row" gap={3}>
  <Image width={{ s: "100px", m: "150px" }} height={{ s: "100px", m: "150px" }} src="/img/examples/image-retina.webp" borderRadius="medium" />
  <Image width={{ s: "100px", m: "150px" }} height={{ s: "100px", m: "150px" }} src="/wrong.png" borderRadius="medium" fallback={<Icon svg={IconZap} size={8} />} />
</View>
```

We've shipped a new [Image](/content/docs/utilities/image) utility for displaying images and controlling their behavior.
It supports rendering image assets based on the screen pixel density and provides multiple fallback options when image asset is not available or was not loaded correctly.

## MenuItem.Aligner utility

```preview
<View width="200px" gap={2}>
  <Text variant="title-3">Documentation</Text>
  <MenuItem.Aligner>
    <View gap={1}>
      <MenuItem selected size="small" roundedCorners>Overview</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem size="small" roundedCorners>Installation</MenuItem>
    </View>
  </MenuItem.Aligner>
</View>
```

Displaying a title for a menu section is such a common case and we don't want anyone to count the pixels they need for the negative margins.
Because of that, we've implemented a utility that is similar to `Button.Aligner`.
It aligns the contents of the [MenuItem](/content/docs/components/menu-item) with the content used around it, no matter which `size` you use them with.

## Overview page

<Image src="/img/releases/overview.webp" bordered />

One of the core documentation parts missing before was a place to have all available components at glance.
People had to literally go through every single page in the docs to see what we have in the library.
In 1.2 we're finally addressing this with a revamped [overview page](/content/docs/getting-started/overview) that has previews of every single component in the library and structured access to utilities and hooks from the same page.

### Other improvements

**Figma:**

- [Button](/content/docs/components/button):
  - ☝️ merged regular and rounded buttons into a single component
  - ☝️reduced variants by 50% by supporting icon-start and icon-end properties
  - changed “icon” toggle to “show icon”
  - aligned icon size for several large button instances
- [Checkbox](/content/docs/components/checkbox): fixed conflicting property names: value - “show value”, helper “show helper”
- [Radio](/content/docs/components/radio): fixed conflicting property names: value - “show value”, helper “show helper”

**React:**

- [Actionable](/content/docs/utilities/actionable): added support for non-interactive Actionable cases to avoid displaying unnecessary focus ring
- [Alert](/content/docs/components/alert): optimized rendered markup for cases where not all Alert properties are used
- [AspectRatio](/content/docs/utilities/aspect-ratio): switched to using aspect-ratio CSS feature and removed unnecessary wrappers used for custom ratio implementation
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): updated `outline` variant to use `neutral-faded` border color token
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): added `startIcon` and `endIcon` properties instead of now deprecated `icon` and `iconPosition` to support displaying both icons simultaneously. This is not a breaking change and old behavior still works as expected.
- [Button.Aligner](/content/docs/components/button): added `string` type support for its `position` property
- [MenuItem](/content/docs/components/menu-item): added `startIcon` property instead of now deprecated `icon` to align with other component's API. This is not a breaking change and old behavior still works as expected.
- [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover): fixed edge cases when content was blinking for Popovers used with active by default
- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): optimized rendered markup when using multiple stacks nested in each other
- [Text](/content/docs/utilities/text): added `maxLines` property to truncate the text based on the passed number of lines
- [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field): added `startIcon` and `endIcon` properties instead of now deprecated `icon` and `iconPosition` to support displaying both icons simultaneously. This is not a breaking change and old behavior still works as expected.
- [ThemeProvider](/content/docs/utilities/theme-provider): fixed an issue with height inheritance that caused scope themes to take extra space on the page
- [Tooltip](/content/docs/components/tooltip): added `active` property to support manually controlling the tooltip display

**Website:**

- Prioritised two new components that now have Coming soon pages: [Breadcrumbs](/content/docs/components/breadcrumbs) and [Toast](/content/docs/components/toast)
- Added documentation search for the Coming soon components
- Added integration guide for [Remix](https://remix.run) and a [Remix starter example](https://github.com/@uicapsule/components/community/tree/master/examples/remix-starter) in our community repoository

<Release version="1.1.0" date="2022-05-24" />

## Alert component

```preview
<View width="400px" maxWidth="100%">
  <Alert
    color="primary"
    title="New version is available"
    icon={IconZap}
    actionsSlot={<Link variant="plain">View now</Link>}
  >
    Find out which new features are available in the upcoming UICapsule release
  </Alert>
</View>
```

We've shipped a new [Alert](/content/docs/components/alert) component that can be used for displaying prominent messages related to the whole page or a specific area.
It comes in 4 different colors, supports horizontal layout direction and works with any type of content.

## Faded border color tokens

☝️ In case you have custom themes built with UICapsule, don't forget to run the generation script for them to get these new tokens available in your theme.

```preview
<View gap={3} direction="row">
  <View
    backgroundColor="primary-faded"
    borderColor="primary-faded"
    borderRadius="medium"
    width="60px"
    height="60px"
  />
  <View
    backgroundColor="positive-faded"
    borderColor="positive-faded"
    borderRadius="medium"
    width="60px"
    height="60px"
  />
  <View
    backgroundColor="critical-faded"
    borderColor="critical-faded"
    borderRadius="medium"
    width="60px"
    height="60px"
  />
</View>
```

We have added three new color tokens for `faded` borders.
They work perfectly for decorative elements that don't need to meet 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio requirements.
For example, we use these tokens ourselves in the newly released [Alert](/content/docs/components/alert) component.

## Figma library updates

We've adopted the [latest features](https://www.figma.com/whats-new/) that Figma announced during Config 2022: individual strokes, instance swap for icons, slot selection, text properties, boolean properties and more.
This brings more control for library users as well as better alignment with code.
In some cases though connection to the master component may be lost: please read through the bullet points marked with ☝️ before updating your mockups.

<Release version="1.0.0" date="2022-05-07" />

<Image src="/img/releases/release.png" />

After two years of active development, we've finally reached an important milestone.
Today we're releasing the 1.0 version of UICapsule for React and Figma and we're live on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/@uicapsule/components).

With this release, we're starting to follow our [release strategy](/content/docs/getting-started/release-strategy) with no more breaking changes for the following year.
It means that the library has reached a stable state, and you can update to any upcoming minor release in a matter of minutes.

Until June 10, we're keeping early-bird prices to celebrate the release, and we hope you enjoy using UICapsule as much as we do ourselves.

## Website improvements

- We have updated our Figma integration documentation, including a new section on how to handle library updates
- Both React and Figma video demos have been updated and made more than 2 times shorter while keeping all relevant content in
- We have added a new FAQ page and revamped the content we had previously

## Library improvements

☝️ In case you have custom themes built with UICapsule, don't forget to run the generation script for them to get these new tokens available in your theme.

- Design tokens: Updated backgroundPrimaryFaded value to better align it with other colors in dark mode
- [Actionable](/content/docs/utilities/actionable): Removed native highlight color as a part of Actionable css reset
- [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover): Added scoped theming support for the content rendered inside the portal
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu): Added scoped theming support for the content rendered inside the portal
- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Added dynamic height support for the selected tab indicator in the pill variant
- [Card](/content/docs/components/card): Updated `bleed` property to only support numbers

<Release version="0.21.0" date="2022-04-20" />

## New color tokens

☝️ In case you have custom themes built with UICapsule, don't forget to run the generation script for them to get these new tokens available in your theme.

```preview
<Button color="positive">
  Complete registration
</Button>
```

We've made a few improvements to our available color tokens to make theming support even more customisation cases:

- Started generating `on-background-highlighted` color tokens separately from regular `on-background` ones. This allows you to completely change the background color of a component in the highlighted state while keeping it accessible for users.
- Added new `background-positive-highlighted` color in order to introduce `positive` Button variant.
- Updated default tokens with more vibrant default values.

## React 18 compatibility

We've gone through the whole library and tested everything for React 18 compatibility.
To confirm that it's all working in external environments, we've also migrated this website to React 18.

React 18 was added to our package peer dependencies and you can start your project migration.
However, make sure all other dependencies you use are compatible with React 18, there are a few Typescript changes that a lot of packages are catching up with.

## Properties in the documentation

We have updated property tables for all components and utilities to make them more scannable.
They also now contain icon indicators for responsive and required properties.

## Other improvements

- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Added `positive` variant support
- [Checkbox](/content/docs/components/checkbox): Removed unused aria-describedby attribute
- [Icon](/content/docs/utilities/icon): Added attributes.style support
- [Icon](/content/docs/utilities/icon): Fixed justify-content value for `autoWidth` icons
- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added automatic `key` assignment for the `Hidden` children
- [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field): Added support for `iconPosition` to render an icon on the end side of the field

<Release version="0.20.0" date="2022-03-27" />

## Token access

We're adding support for installing UICapsule by access tokens.
Since we're not publishing the library on the public NPM, this should help 3rd party tools to easier integrate with our design system and install it as a dependency without manually downloading the system.
In the future we might also explore this approach as our default way for installing the library in any codebase.

Meanwhile, if this is something you would like to see working in your tool or you want to be able to install UICapsule in your codebase - [send us a message](mailto:hello@@uicapsule/components.so).

## Other improvements

- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Renamed outlined variant to outline to keep API consistent with Badge
- Updated `m` viewport values to `661px`-`900px` to simplify responsive design and development
- Updated values for `highlighted` color tokens in the default UICapsule theme

**React:**

- [Actionable](/content/docs/utilities/actionable): Removed default :active style
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Updated :active style to scale down on click
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Automated on-background text colors for `primary`, `constructive` and `critical` Frames to keep the text contrast ratio accessible by default
- [ThemeProvider](/content/docs/utilities/theme-provider): Added className support
- [UICapsule provider](/content/docs/utilities/@uicapsule/components): Added className support
- [Backdrop](/content/docs/utilities/backdrop): Fixed absolutely positioned elements z-index inside Backdrop conflicting with page elements in Safari

**Figma:**

- [Avatar](/content/docs/components/avatar): Updated an image used in the component by default
- [Badge](/content/docs/components/badge): Updated copy for all variants to “Badge” to keep overrides while switching variants
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Updated copy for all variants to “Button” to keep overrides while switching variants
- [Switch](/content/docs/components/switch): added interactive component support
- Added component library version to the name to help swap libaries

<Release version="0.19.0" date="2022-03-14" />

## Updated brand

During the past two months we've been working on updating our brand and our brand assets.
There are still a few things we're going to roll-out before 1.0 gets released but today we're shipping our renamed library and the new landing page.

We're renaming to UICapsule, which means there are a few things that are renamed in the code:

- Name of the NPM package was changed to `@uicapsule/components`
- Arcade provider is now called UICapsule provider
- Main theme is called `@uicapsule/components`
- CSS variables a new short `--uic` prefix instead of `--arcade`

## Server side rendering support for theming in NextJS

We're changing our theming approach just a bit to make it work with NextJS server-side rendering.
Theme definitions now rely on the `data-uic-theme` attribute which means you can assign it in the `_document.jsx` file without importing .css files.

```code
<body data-uic-theme="uicapsule-light">
```

## Component changes

- [Avatar](/content/docs/components/avatar): Added an `alt` property and made it render as an `img` tag instead of using backround
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Fixed rounded border-radius when used with `size="large"`
- [Card](/content/docs/components/card): Added responsive syntax support for the `padding` property
- [Container](/content/docs/utilities/container): Replaced `size` property with `width` to allow more granular control over its dimensions
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added `base` and `elevated` background support
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added responsive syntax for `height` and `width` properties
- [Divider](/content/docs/utilities/divider): Added automatic `aria-orientation` support
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu): Updated focus management to return focus back to the trigger element on pressing Tab instead of moving it to the next one
- [Loader](/content/docs/components/loader): Added `aria-label` and `aria-live` support
- [Progress](/content/docs/components/progress): Added `duration` support to make animated progress bars
- [Hidden](/content/docs/utilities/hidden): Added `inline` property for hidden text elements
- Updated border color token values in dark mode

<Release version="0.18.0" date="2022-01-16" />

## Integrations

We've updated framework integrations guidelines and moved them to a separate documentation section on the website.
All example projects have been updated with the latest dependencies and their setup has been simplified.

In addition to that, we have added Gatsby starter example and documentation.
Check its documentation in the Integrations sections in our docs.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink
    title="Gatsby integration"
    href="/content/docs/getting-started/integrations/gatsby"
  />
</Grid>

## UICapsule config

In this release, we've updated the way you can add custom themes.
Instead of working with `createTheme` and `createThemeFragment` functions, themes are created from an `@uicapsule/components.config.js` file.
You can store in the root level of the repository or provide a custom path to our theming CLI.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink
    title="Creating themes"
    href="/content/docs/theming/creating-themes"
  />
</Grid>

## Other improvements

- [Avatar](/content/docs/components/avatar): Added support for dynamic size values which means you can pass any unit token to it
- [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field): Normalized input value suggestion style

---

<Release version="0.17.0" date="2021-12-25" />

## Figma library

<Image src="/img/releases/figma-release.png" />

This release is the first one to include UICapsule Figma library which is available for both regular and source code licenses.
Library consists of 3 files that include:

- Figma components with variants and auto-layout that are aligned with code
- File with design tokens for light mode
- File with design tokens for dark mode

With the help of Figma Themer plugin, you'll be able to design your product just once and switching to dark mode will happen automatically without any manual customisation.
This works not only with UICapsule components but also with any custom component you create yourself.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Figma setup" href="/content/docs/figma-setup" />
  <CrossLink title="Design tokens" href="/content/docs/tokens/overview" />
</Grid>

## New pricing tiers

Along with Figma release, we're also updating our pricing tiers.

First of all, even though we're adding Figma library to the list, we're keeping our single seat license to $79 while we're getting closer to v1.0 release of UICapsule.
Shortly after the release its price is going to raise to $99.

Team licenses now scale based on the amount of seats you purchase with increasing discounts which means now you get a better deal for 2-3 people teams.

On top of that we're adding two new tiers:

- **Source code**, for teams building their own design system and who want to use UICapsule as a starting point and skip the whole setup phase. Additionally it could useful for front-end and design teams willing to learn new best practices and dive deeper into the internals of UICapsule for new ideas.
- **Enterprise**, for companies who need more than just code and design files. We can help you with onboarding to UICapsule, in-house design system workshops, audits or other activities tailored to your needs.

<Grid>
  <CrossLink title="Pricing tiers" href="/pricing" />
</Grid>

## Other improvements

- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added support for responsive `padding` property values.
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added support for new background color values.
- [Hidden](/content/docs/utilities/hidden): Added `visibility` flag to work with CSS visibility property instead of display. This is helpful when you want to hide an element visually but keep its space reserved and avoid content jumps.
- [Hidden](/content/docs/utilities/hidden): Aligned responsive syntax with other components. Instead of providing `from` and `to` value, you can now use `hide` property with the regular responsive properties syntax.
- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added support for multiple `Stack.Item` using `grow` in the same Stack.
- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added support for defining Stack `height`.
- [Text](/content/docs/utilities/text): Added support for line-through decoration.

---

<Release version="0.16.0" date="2021-12-03" />

In this release, we've updated the way we generate output of the theming engine and the way themes are used in the code.
We've moved away from theme components and ColorMode utility to a single ThemeProvider component that works with both, scoped themes and color modes.
This allowed us to avoid additional rerenders of the app when a theme changes and reduced the complexity of theming in general.

```code
import { UICapsule, ThemeProvider } from "@uicapsule/components";
import @uicapsule/componentsTheme from "@uicapsule/components/themes/@uicapsule/components.module.css";
import productTheme from "themes/product.module.css";

const Application = () => (
  <UICapsule theme={@uicapsule/componentsTheme}>
    UICapsule theme is used here
    <ThemeProvider theme={productTheme}>Product theme is used here</ThemeProvider>
  </UICapsule>
);
```

### Library bundle

For the cases where using our ESM build output is not possible, we're now additionally providing UICapsule JS and CSS bundles.
This will disable regular tree-shaking of the modules but makes it possible to use the library in environments that currently don't support CSS imports from within node_modules.
However this shouldn't affect the performance much considering that current library total size is lest than `40kb` including both CSS and JS.

To use the bundles, you can import them directly from the package.
Note that you will need to import styles just once.

```code
import { Button } from "@uicapsule/components";
import "@uicapsule/components.css";
```

### Other improvements

- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Adjusted size to align better with other components
- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Adjusted focus selector area to better respect tab item content
- Updated border radius values across components
- Updated foundation names and values to align with Figma and improve default theme quality
- Added [ThemeProvider](/content/docs/utilities/theme-provider) component and [useTheme](/content/docs/hooks/use-theme) hook

---

<Release version="0.15.0" date="2021-11-14" />

After 3 months of design work we're finalising our Figma library with all the components moving into testing phase.
All components are designed with variants, auto-layout and paying incredible attention to handling composition of components the same way you would do that in code.
Both React and Figma libraries are perfectly aligned so anything you can design with UICapsule Figma library - you can immediately implement in code with no problems.

### Design tokens documentation

```preview
<View gap={3} direction="row" align="center">
  <div
    style={{
      background: "var(--uic-color-background-primary)",
      borderRadius: "var(--uic-unit-radius-small)",
      width: 24,
      height: 24,
    }}
  />

  <Text variant="body-medium-2" color="neutral-faded">
    --uic-color-background-primary
  </Text>
</View>
```

We have revamped our [design tokens documentation](/content/docs/tokens/overview) and added visual examples for all UICapsule tokens.
Every token type now has a separate page, going through their values and guidelines on how to use them.

### Other improvements

### Figma progress

We have passed 50% of our Figma library progress with 12 components and design token library ready.
Everything is already built with theming/dark mode support, using auto-layout and providing variants for every component.

If you want to track the progress, you can do that in our [project board](https://blvworkspace.notion.site/64cf1f5713344a7383330e0402f43949?v=b88a6dbbcb9a4faeb867d40d09ec0b12).

<Release version="0.12.0" date="2021-10-03" />

### RGB color tokens support

When using colors as variables in CSS, you would usually hit a wall when you want to apply custom opacity values to them.
The only way to combine a color variable with opacity is to use it with `rgba()` color function in CSS.

In order to support this case, we've added auto-generation for rgb values of the background color tokens.
They use similar names to background token names with an additional `rgb` prefix:

```css
var(--uic-color-rgb-background-neutral) /* 223, 226, 234 */
```

Note that the variable stores only the rgb values themselves but doesn't wrap it with a function.
This means you can now use it together with `rgba()` color function in your css:

```css
background: rgba(var(--uic-color-rgb-background-neutral), 0.5);
```

### Other improvements

- [Avatar](/content/docs/components/avatar): Adjusted icon size in `larger` Avatar size, added faded colors support.
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Updated neutral Button to use `inherit` Loader color, added `white` and `black` colors support for rendering on media content.
- [Card](/content/docs/components/card): Add custom padding value support.
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` properties.
- [Icon](/content/docs/utilities/icon): Added `smallest` size value, added `inherit` size support.
- [Link](/content/docs/components/link): Added `critical` color, added `icon` support.
- [Select](/content/docs/components/select): Aligned Select height with Button height on mobile viewports.
- [Stack](/content/docs/components/view): Stack.Item `split` flag migrated to `gap="auto"`.
- [Switch](/content/docs/components/switch): Updated the disabled checked background color to use `primary` color.
- [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field): Aligned TextField height with Button height on mobile viewports.

<Release version="0.11.0" date="2021-09-19" />

### UICapsule video demo

On the hompage, we now have a video demo for those who want to take a look of how the development process looks like.
In the demo we are building a social media card with some common layouts and interactive behavior that you would usually see in your day-to-day job.
Additionally, we show how theming and dark mode work with no extra effort or requirements to write custom styling logic on your side.

### Chained trap focus

While building interfaces we have to implement complex behaviors like modal being opened from a dropdown.
Both of these components should trap the focus and return it back to the trigger element when closed.
Starting with this release with support chained trap focus.
It will return the focus back to the correct trigger even if some of the trigger elements are no longer rendered on the screen.

For example, try going through the whole flow using your keyboard in the following example.
Once you close the modal, focus will return to the "Open menu" button.

**Hint:** Click near the button first and press `Tab`, to focus on the button using keyboard.

```preview
function ChainTrapFocus() {
  const { active, activate, deactivate } = useToggle(false);

  return (
    <>
      <DropdownMenu>
        <DropdownMenu.Trigger>
          {(attributes) => <Button attributes={attributes}>Open menu</Button>}
        </DropdownMenu.Trigger>
        <DropdownMenu.Content>
          <DropdownMenu.Item onClick={activate}>Open modal</DropdownMenu.Item>
          <DropdownMenu.Item>Second menu item</DropdownMenu.Item>
        </DropdownMenu.Content>
      </DropdownMenu>
      <Modal active={active} onClose={deactivate}>
        <View gap={3}>
          <Dismissible onClose={deactivate} closeAriaLabel="Close modal">
            <Modal.Title>Modal title</Modal.Title>
            <Modal.Subtitle>Modal subtitle</Modal.Subtitle>
          </Dismissible>
          Dialogs present a distinct choice to users through their title, content, and actions.
          <Button onClick={deactivate}>Got it</Button>
        </View>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Other improvements

- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): `Elevated` flag support.
- [Container](/content/docs/utilities/container): Fixed layout issues when used inside other flexbox elements.
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu): Added custom `width` support.

- [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added automatic wrap handling for Stack.Item using `grow` and `split` with responsive values.
- [Backdrop](/content/docs/utilities/backdrop): Darkened the background to improve the contrast ratio of the backdrop content with the page.
- [useElementId](/content/docs/hooks/use-element-id): Fixed id generation for React.StrictMode development mode.
- [UICapsule theme](/content/docs/tokens/overview): Reduced the line-height of caption1 font token.

---

<Release version="0.10.0" date="2021-08-16" />

### New homepage

Our homepage has been completely revamped to put emphasize on the newly released features, including our recent theming engine.
You can try applying one of the 3 demo themes to our whole website, including their light and dark modes.

### More stack improvements

- Stack.Item now has `gap` support. This comes handy when you need a list of elements with different gaps and lets you achieve that without nesting multiple Stacks in each other.
- Stack got improved nested responsive properties support, including bug fixes for the edge cases found that were not supported before.
- Inline and reversed flags got merged into a single direction property for better responsive properties support.
- Vertical stack now automatically take full height of its parent to make controlling its children alignment easier.

### Other improvements

- ThemeMode: Renamed to ColorMode.
- ColorMode: Added default foreground color reset for ColorMode scopes instead of using the global text color.
- Hidden: Migrated to `from` and `till` properties to provide better support of responsive values.
- Text: Added `align` property.
- Text: Added text color transition for cases when parent is controlling the color value.
- Card: Added `selected` flag.
- UICapsule Provider: Improved switching between root-level themes

---

<Release version="0.9.0" date="2021-07-28" />

### Dynamic responsive properties

`Stack` is the core of any layout you build, and we want it to be as flexible as possible.
Starting with 0.9.0 we are using CSS variables to work with responsive styles, and we've started with `Stack` component integration.
Till now, we've only supported a limited number of values that you could use as `gap` property because its styles have been predefined in CSS.
With the new responsive CSS variables, we're changing `gap` property to support any numerical value as a multiplier of the base unit token.

This change includes both, regular and responsive properties, which means you can pass any number you want for every viewport size:

```code
<View gap={{ s: 2, l: 10 }} />
```

With this new approach, we're shipping a couple more features for the `Stack` component:

- `Grid` is finally merged with `Stack`. `Stack.Item` now supports `size` property while all other properties stay the same.
- `Stack` now supports responsive `wrap` property to control `flex-wrap` manually.
- `Stack.Item` now supports responsive `order` property to control the order of items rendering.

### Logical properties for RTL

We've moved away from supporting RTL during build step with a PostCSS plugin and are using [CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/content/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) now instead.
This takes us one step closer to moving away from CSS build step and using completely native CSS.
Additionally, this update helped us improve a handful components and how they render in RTL mode.

### Bundle size

We have added `size-limit` integration to our merge requests which lets us track all the bundle size changes as one of our main metrics.
For example, even after introducing all these new features and responsive styles, we have actually reduced our total bundle size by 2kb down to 41kb.

---

<Release version="0.8.0" date="2021-07-17" />

### Theming Engine

<Image src="/img/releases/theming.png" />

We're finally releasing out theming engine, including completely typed JS API and CLI to build themes using UICapsule design tokens.
Writing your theme definition once will build a React component for you that's ready to be imported into your application.
Among other features its main highlights are:

- All theming happens in build time and doesn't affect your runtime performance.
- Dark mode is supported on the design tokens level. No need to write conditionals in your components.
- Scoped theming support which makes it easy to use multiple themes in the same application.
- Theme fragments which define only a part of a theme to save your bundle size

### Other improvements

- Added additional viewport boundaries checks for mobile viewports in Popover.
- Fixed Popover with `triggerType="hover"` affecting how other Popovers on the page work.

---

<Release version="0.7.0" date="2021-06-19" />

### UICapsule demo

<Image src="/img/releases/demo.png" />

For this release we've built our first demo of a page using UICapsule.
It's aiming to provide a publicly available example of a project setup as well as giving a hint about how building interfaces with UICapsule looks like.

- Project repository: https://github.com/@uicapsule/components/demo
- Deployed project: https://@uicapsule/components.github.io/demo/

### Responsive properties API update

We've started supporting more scenarios for responsive development.
In this release we're adding another viewport support to differentiate between portrait and landscape tablet modes.
This means that our viewport media queries names have been updated accordingly:

```css
@media (--uic-viewport-s) @media (--uic-viewport-m) @media (--uic-viewport-l) @media (--uic-viewport-xl);
```

To make the components easier to use with 4 viewports available, we're also switching from array notation to an object notation for the responsive properties.
Since we use mobile-first approach, you don't have to define values for every viewport manually.
For example, you can set the Stack gap to be `x2` by default and change to `x4` starting with large viewport size.

```js
<View gap={{ s: 2, l: 4 }}>
```

### Other improvements

- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Fixed button animation blinking in iOS Safari
- [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover): Improved keyboard navigation defaults for triggerType="hover"

### Rethinking Stack utility

```preview
<View>
  <Placeholder />

  <View direction="row">
    <Placeholder />
    <View.Item grow>
      <Placeholder />
    </View.Item>
    <Placeholder />
  </View>

  <View direction="row">
    <View width="200px">
      <Placeholder />
    </View>
    <View.Item grow>
      <Placeholder />
    </View.Item>
  </View>
</View>
```

We've completely rebuilt our [Stack](/content/docs/utilities/view) component from ground up to cover a huge number of new edge cases.
Most of our focus went into improving nested stacks, edge cases for specific components and reducing the number of elements rendered per every stack:

- Refactored the usage of children removing all unnecessary item wrappers
- Aligned `gap` property naming with token names.
- Added item grow support to divided stack.
- Improved support for button elements rendered as direct Stack children.
- Added support for nested Stacks with flex-wrap: nowrap.
- Added responsive property support for Stack.Item grow.
- Improved AspectRatio and Card default layout calculations when used in Stack.

We've also tried using the new `gap` API for flexbox which turned out not so well, due to the limited Safari support and some [webkit bugs](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225278) that have to be fixed first.
Once the state of the API becomes more stable, we will immediately migrate to it.

### Other improvements

- [Actionable](/content/docs/utilities/actionable): Added custom tag support with `as` property.
- [ActionBar](/content/docs/component/action-bar): Added `large` size support.
- [Button](/content/docs/components/button): Removed min-width from the text button variant.
- [Container](/content/docs/utilities/container): Added size presets for its max-width.
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu): Added small gaps between menu items.
- [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu): Fixed a bug which sometimes caused dropdown menu stay open after its close was triggerred.
- [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view): Added support for any padding value as a unit design token multiplier.
- [Link](/content/docs/components/link): Added `color` and `underline` properties.
- [Switch](/content/docs/components/switch): Improved keyboard navigation support when used inside Popover and Modal.
- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Replaced navigation arrows with fade-out for scrolling tabs on mobile.
- [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs): Improved the navigation arrows toggle throttling.

### Tabs: New variants

```preview
<Tabs variant="pills">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item id="0">Item 1</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="1">Long item 2</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="2">Very long item 3</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
</Tabs>
```

[Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs) get 2 new variants to support new UI scenarios.
`borderless` is helpful when it's used with parent component that provides its own border already.
`pills` variant is used for less prominent secondary navigation.

### Other improvements

- [Dismissible](/content/docs/utilities/dismissible) got min-height defined in case it has no content provided.
- [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover) got its keyboard navigation improved when it has no focusable elements in it.

### Progress component

```preview
<View width="300px" maxWidth="100%" gap={3}>
  <Progress value={25} color="primary" />
  <Progress value={50} color="critical" />
  <Progress value={75} color="positive" />
</View>
```

We release [Progress component](/content/docs/components/progress) to the progress status for a task that takes a long time or consists of several steps.
In some cases it can be used for other types of context, like displaying the score values etc.

### Overlay component

```preview
<View borderRadius="medium" overflow="hidden" width="300px" maxWidth="100%">
  <Overlay
    position="bottom"
    backgroundSlot={
      <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
        <img src="/img/image.png" alt="Example" />
      </AspectRatio>
    }
  >
    <Text variant="body-strong-2">Canyon trip</Text>
  </Overlay>
</View>
```

We're adding [Overlay component](/content/docs/components/overlay) to let you build nice-looking media cards and display text content on top of them.
You can find which position values it supports in the [documentation](/content/docs/components/overlay).

### Other improvements

- Added [HiddenVisually](/content/docs/utilities/hidden-visually) utility to render test applicable only for screen readers.
- Removed Menu component in favor of MenuItem composition with existing layout components like Grid or Stack.
- Added [Button](/content/docs/components/button) text variant that have padding around the text.
- Removed [Link](/content/docs/components/link) icon support since that can be achieved with Button component now.
- Add `inherit` color support for the [TextField](/content/docs/components/text-field) to use them on any background.
- Added `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius` and `overflow` for the [Frame](/content/docs/utilities/view) utility.
- Improved focus trap functionality for components like [Modal](/content/docs/components/modal) and [Popover](/content/docs/components/popover).
- Added a color property for [Icon](/content/docs/utilities/icon) when you want to override a color coming from the parent element.
- Added an internal Portal utility that helps with managing z-index values of the components.

### Tabs component

```preview
<Tabs defaultActiveId="1">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item id="0">Components</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="1" icon={IconZap}>
      Utilities
    </Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="2">Hooks</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>

  <Tabs.Panel id="0">
    <View padding={4}>Components tab</View>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel id="1">
    <View padding={4}>Utilities tab</View>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel id="2">
    <View padding={4}>Hooks tab</View>
  </Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs>
```

We release [Tabs](/content/docs/components/tabs) component to let you organise navigation between multiple pages or content sections.
Its compound components approach lets you easily build custom tab panels or add animation to them, and it's responsive out-of-the-box.
Read more about it in its [documentation](/content/docs/components/tabs).

### Dropdown menu component

```preview
<DropdownMenu>
  <DropdownMenu.Trigger>
    {(attributes) => <Button attributes={attributes}>Open</Button>}
  </DropdownMenu.Trigger>
  <DropdownMenu.Content>
    <DropdownMenu.Item>Action 1</DropdownMenu.Item>
    <DropdownMenu.Item>Action 2</DropdownMenu.Item>
  </DropdownMenu.Content>
</DropdownMenu>
```

We're adding a [DropdownMenu](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu) component built on top of `Popover` to simplify the process of building action menus.
It works with a similar API as `Popover` does, however it encapsulates some of its logic, which means you don't have to pass all the right props and aria attributes to `Popover` manually.
Read more about it in its [documentation](/content/docs/components/dropdown-menu).

### Other improvements

- Popover, Tooltip: Improved the usage of accessibility attributes on their trigger and content components
- Popover: Separated trapFocusMode and navigationMode into separate properties
- Menu: Adjusted the gap size between an icon and content in the small Menu.Item
- Actionable: Added a flag to apply the focus ring inside the element boundaries to make it work better with overflow: hidden parents
- Dismissible: Simplified properties API
- AspectRatio: Added default size styles for the img elements used inside it
- Color design tokens: Simplified the usage of color tokens that include state
